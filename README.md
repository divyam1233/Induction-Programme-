# Induction-Programme-

# Day 1
My first day at GNDEC started by taking blessings from Waheguru ji at Gurudwara Sahib along with other CSE and IT students in college itself. This helped to calm my inner turmoil.

Then there was arrangement of offertory i.e. langar seva. Eating it helped pacify my appetite. 

After that all the students gathered in the auditorium. Students were introduced to the college's legacy through a college orientation presentation, followed by a motivational video featuring proud alumni of the college — Sangam Arora and Arshpreet Singh (Batch 2025) — sharing how dedication and involvement beyond the classroom shaped their successful journeys.

Later insightful addresses were shared by:
* Dr. Sehijpal Singh (Principal)
* Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal (HOD, Applied Sciences)
* Dr. Akshay Girdhar (Dean Academics)
* Dr. Parminder Singh (Dean Student Welfare)

The Guests of Honour skyrocketed the pace of the moment by their inspirational and positive words. The Guests of Honour were: 
* Er. Ravinder Garg — Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana
* Er. Rakesh Kumar — GNDEC Alumnus (Batch 1991), ADC Ludhiana

The event concluded with a Vote of Thanks by Dr. K.S.Mann, HOD IT.
