# Induction-Programme-

# Day 1
My first day at GNDEC started by taking blessings from Waheguru ji at Gurudwara Sahib along with other CSE and IT students in college itself. This helped to calm my inner turmoil.

Then there was arrangement of offertory i.e. langar seva. Eating it helped pacify my appetite. 

After that all the students gathered in the auditorium. Students were introduced to the college's legacy through a college orientation presentation, followed by a motivational video featuring proud alumni of the college — Sangam Arora and Arshpreet Singh (Batch 2025) — sharing how dedication and involvement beyond the classroom shaped their successful journeys.

Later insightful addresses were shared by:
* __Dr. Sehijpal Singh__ (Principal)
* __Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal__ (HOD, Applied Sciences)
* __Dr. Akshay Girdhar__ (Dean Academics)
* __Dr. Parminder Singh__ (Dean Student Welfare)

The Guests of Honour skyrocketed the pace of the moment by their inspirational and positive words. The Guests of Honour were: 
* __Er. Ravinder Garg__ — Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana
* __Er. Rakesh Kumar__ — GNDEC Alumnus (Batch 1991), ADC Ludhiana

The event in auditorium concluded with a Vote of Thanks by __Dr. K.S.Mann__, HOD IT.

Eventually there was a department tour for every branch just to give us the knowledge regarding our respective branches and subjects. There we got to know the concept of mentorship. After that we were told about working of labs. 

Hence the event culminated on a happy note.

The induction program continued with more engaging activities. From exploring values to assessing skills, the day was packed with a purpose! 

English and Maths Proficiency Tests were conducted for all streams to assess foundational skills. The tests included questions from grassroot level to competency level to check the retaining power and test our knowledge of previous classes.

# Day 4
Another magnificent day at GNDEC, Ludhiana welcomed the students of CSE and IT with interactive and engaging sessions.

The chronology was as following: 
* Peer to Peer session with seniors where they introduced us to world of coding. The session of C++ meant to clear basics of students regarding coding. It helped students delve deep into this world. This session was indeed helpful for us and cleared our many doubts too.

* Next began session of Communicative English where every student in the classroom were asked to introduce themselves. This helped us to know each other better. The teacher corrected us at every point we made a mistake. She inspired us to be confident especially while public speaking. We learnt a lot in that session.

* Eventually, all the students from CSE and IT gathered in the auditorium
