# Induction-Programme-

# Day 1
My first day at GNDEC started by taking blessings from Waheguru ji at Gurudwara Sahib along with other CSE and IT students in college itself. This helped to calm my inner turmoil.

Then there was arrangement of offertory i.e. langar seva. Eating it helped pacify my appetite. 

After that all the students gathered in the auditorium. Students were introduced to the college's legacy through a college orientation presentation, followed by a motivational video featuring proud alumni of the college — Sangam Arora and Arshpreet Singh (Batch 2025) — sharing how dedication and involvement beyond the classroom shaped their successful journeys.

Later insightful addresses were shared by:
* Dr. Sehijpal Singh (Principal)
* Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal (HOD, Applied Sciences)
* Dr. Akshay Girdhar (Dean Academics)
* Dr. Parminder Singh (Dean Student Welfare)

The Guests of Honour skyrocketed the pace of the moment by their inspirational and positive words. The Guests of Honour were: 
* Er. Ravinder Garg — Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana
* Er. Rakesh Kumar — GNDEC Alumnus (Batch 1991), ADC Ludhiana

The event in auditorium concluded with a Vote of Thanks by Dr. K.S.Mann, HOD IT.

Eventually there was a department tour for every branch just to give us the knowledge regarding our respective branches and subjects. There we got to know the concept of mentorship. After that we were told about working of labs. 

Hence the event culminated on a happy note.


# Day 2
The induction program continued with more engaging activities. From exploring values to assessing skills, the day was packed with a purpose! 

English and Maths Proficiency Tests were conducted for all streams to assess foundational skills. The tests included questions from grassroot level to competency level to check the retaining power and test our knowledge of previous classes. 

After that CSE and IT students gathered in auditorium for expert talks by: 
* Dr. Priya Darshni on "Universal Human Values – 1"
* Dr. Arvind Dhingra on student development via STEP & TAC
* Dr. Arashdeep Singh on "Food: A Pivotal Role in Student's Overall Wellness"
